opensmtprelay
=============

A few years ago, it was possible to have courier-imap update the open-smtp
relay file with it's authvchkpw module. This feature and thus imap-before-smtp
disappeared with the introduction of courier-authdaemond because the vchkpw
code of authdaemond does not have a chance to see the TCPREMOTEIP environment
variable.

This little setuid wrapper re-enables imap-before-smtp, calling vpopmails
open_smtp_relay(). It has to replace the imapd command in your courier-imap
startup script and will exec imapd, after opening the smtp relay, wile
imap-login is still in place to authenticate via authdaemond's vchkpw module.

==============

Might be useful to you, if you noticed that the tcp.smtp.cdb does not always 
contain the IPs of the open-smtp file:

$ for ip in $(sed -re 's/:.*//' < open-smtp); do \
    cdbget $ip < tcp.smtp.cdb > /dev/null \
        || echo "$ip is missing"; \
    done

The vpopmail FAQ claims that clearopensmtp is requesting locks on the 
open-smtp(.lock) file, but the source does not read like it would.

Run this program regularly instead of clearopensmtp.
